```

### Running with Custom Config
```bash
python naukri_job_applier.py --config custom_config.json
```

## How It Works

1. **Login**: Automatically logs into your Naukri.com account
2. **Job Search**: Searches for Java backend developer jobs with 3+ years experience
3. **Application Process**:
   - Opens each job posting
   - Checks if it's an external application
   - If external: Shortlists for manual application
   - If internal: Automatically fills and submits the application
4. **Tracking**: Records all applications to avoid duplicates
5. **Reporting**: Generates logs and shortlisted jobs CSV

## Output Files

- `applied_jobs.csv`: Record of all successfully applied jobs
- `shortlisted_jobs_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`: Jobs requiring manual application
- `naukri_applications.log`: Detailed application logs

## External Application Detection

The script automatically detects external applications by:
- Checking if the job URL redirects to external websites
- Identifying external redirect patterns in URLs
- Detecting forms that require additional information

External applications are saved to a CSV file for manual review and application.

## Safety Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between applications to avoid being flagged
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Tracks applied jobs to prevent re-application
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Resume Capability**: Can be run multiple times safely

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Failed**
   - Verify your email and password in config.json
   - Check if your Naukri account is active
   - Ensure 2FA is disabled or handle it manually

2. **ChromeDriver Issues**
   - Update Chrome browser to latest version
   - Reinstall ChromeDriver
   - Use webdriver-manager for automatic driver management

3. **No Jobs Found**
   - Check your search criteria in config.json
   - Verify your Naukri profile is complete
   - Try different job keywords

4. **Application Failures**
   - Check the logs for specific error messages
   - Some jobs may have complex application processes
   - External applications are automatically shortlisted

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by modifying the script:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
